# Set up

### Building game / mapedit

To build either the game or the map editor, you must first build the engine.
Install the TypeScript compiler, if you have not already;

```npm install -g typescript```

Then, run the compiler from the engine package; ```tsc```

When you have done so, you must create a [symlink](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link) to the engine package.
Navigate to the game or mapedit package. Then, simply run;

```npm link ../engine``` (or which ever path to the engine package)

You can now build this package normally, using webpack.

### Running the server

To start the server, you must first tell it where to find certain resource files.
To do this, edit the ```"resPath"``` field in exconfig.json.
This path must point to the app/res directory, found in the game package.

I recommend setting up a local web server, with the app directory as its root.
I use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) for this purpose.
